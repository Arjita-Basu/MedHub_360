# 📱 _Automating Healthcare_ 🏥

_**Connecting Doctors and Patients and making hassle free strorage and access to medical information from anywhere**_ <br />

### 🎯 Our Goals :

1.  Extract, store and retrieve medical information from `Medical Reports` using `OCR`.
2.  Display the information online `Graphically` for the use of `Patients` as well as `Doctors` only with `Authorised Access`.
3.  Disease prediction from existing medical records using `ML-Models`, to `Caution Patients and Recommend` them for `Check-Ups.`
4.  Giving an complete health `Analytics` to doctors of `Patients` as well as `Doctors` preseving user privacy.

## 📝 Module-Wise Description

_📌 **Registration**_ <br/>
The web application would have a facility for the user's to register as either doctors or patients. Both of them would have access to specific features of the application.They will have a unique authentication ID so that their data is completely protected and giving access to specific users securely.

_📌 **Data Retrieval System**_ <br/>
So much medical data will obviously not be typed by the patient or else the whole purpose of saving time will be defeated. Hence, the application will do the job itself by scanning paperwork and storing all the relevant data.

_📌 **Medical Record Analytics**_ <br/>
This would enable online storage of patient's documents. It will help preserve the documents and avoid the hassle of carrying them for every consultation. It will also be presented in a pictorial manner so that it is easier to grasp by the patient.

_📌 **Disease Prediction**_ <br/>
The disease prediction by the application will alert the patient to take immediate action before the situation turns sour as in our hectic lives as we don't take the time out for routine checkups.  Also if there is some discrepancy or negligence from the side of the doctor, the patient will realise that.
